This folder manages the location and navigation features of Eventurer — displaying maps and directions for event venues.
It helps users visualize where an event is and how to reach it easily.

⸻

1️⃣ Map.tsx
• Purpose:
Acts as the base map display component for showing the event’s location.
Currently, it serves as a placeholder container but is designed for future integration (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps, or OneMap API).

• Key Features:
	•	Uses a memoized React component (memo) for performance optimization.
	•	Displays a placeholder area for the map with clear structure for later enhancement.
	•	Easy to extend with actual geolocation data and interactive markers.

• Visual Role:
Renders the map frame within the event details page — provides the geographical context of the event.

⸻

2️⃣ HowToGetThere.tsx
• Purpose:
Displays directions and transport info for getting to the event location.
It’s an informative card that combines map visualization and quick-access transport data.

• Key Features:
	•	Imports and embeds the Map component to show the location visually.
	•	Displays static transport information (nearest MRT, bus stops, walking distances).
	•	Uses animations (motion) for smooth entry transitions and a lively UI.
	•	Uses event data (event.location) for dynamic display.

• Visual Role:
Provides a friendly, interactive “How to Get There” section on the Event Details page — balancing both utility and presentation.
